This is the code for my own portfolio website!
I've got a template from nicepage.com, but after setting the color theme and a basic structure in their website editor I got really sick of it, because, let's be real, no one likes these "idiot-proof" editors, right? That's why I took the code and cusomized the hell out of it, played around with the previously set HTML and had some fun with it, also added some JS and a lot of CSS!
